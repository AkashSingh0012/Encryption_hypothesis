Repository Name: stateless-encryption-proto (or any name you prefer)

Description (for GitHub repo):

> A hypothetical encryption protocol designed to be stateless, untraceable, and self-evolving.

This project introduces a novel approach to encryption where each message dynamically evolves its encoding dictionary, ensuring that ciphertext is non-repetitive and decoding logic is never reused. The system minimizes traceability by avoiding shared states and by embedding logic reconstruction capabilities into each transmission.

Core Features:

Stateless encryption with per-message dictionary mutation

Unpredictable binary encoding using shuffled character maps

Encrypted payloads do not depend on any persistent key exchange

Decoding recovery embedded through noise-based seed regeneration

Designed to be untraceable to third parties observing message history
